    description: "In these works, garments are not just fashion—they are intimate containers of stories, migration, survival, and care. I engage in upcycling as a ritual: mending not only fabric, but wounds; deconstructing fast-fashion logic and reimagining the body as an archive. Each intervention is an act of remembrance and resistance, stitched with the hope that what is broken can become whole in new, unexpected ways.",

    poeticStatement: `Some things can’t be packed:
    Tears don’t fit in suitcases,
    nor do the burned photographs left behind.
    I stitch memories into clothes,
    patching the empty spaces,
    embroidering names no one speaks anymore.
    I censor what I was told not to feel:
    shame in the heart,
    anger in the mouth,
    hope on the forehead.
    What I couldn’t carry
    now hangs in front of me:
    like bodies in transit,
    like suspended memories,
    like skin that never forgets.`,

Collage, on the other hand, allows me to assemble fragments—images, textures, torn paper—into quiet narratives. Both practices offer refuge, both are forms of visual journaling that allow me to inhabit time differently.",

In these pieces, I explore the body as a site of memory and resistance, especially in relation to migration and queerness. Performance allows me to inhabit stories that are not only mine, and to share them in ways that move beyond language. It is a way of being, of listening, of offering.",
