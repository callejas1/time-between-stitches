    Tears don’t fit in suitcases,
    nor do the burned photographs left behind.
    I stitch memories into clothes,
    patching the empty spaces,
    embroidering names no one speaks anymore.
    I censor what I was told not to feel:
    shame in the heart,
    anger in the mouth,
    hope on the forehead.
    What I couldn’t carry
    now hangs in front of me:
    like bodies in transit,
    like suspended memories,
    like skin that never forgets.
