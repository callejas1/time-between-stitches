    bio: `I am a textile and performance artist from Nicaragua, currently based in the Netherlands.
          My practice centers around migration, identity, the body, and the politics of dressing. 
          Through second-hand garments, embroidery, and performance, I give space to displaced 
          bodies, overflowing memories, and visible wounds that also serve as testimony and resistance.`,
    statement: `I see sewing as a form of care, of protest, of narrating what has remained unspoken. 
                I work from the memory of the body, the garment as an archive, and the textile gesture as language.`,
